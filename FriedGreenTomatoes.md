## Ingredients
For the tomatoes

* 3 medium, firm green tomatoes, cored and cut into 1/4-inch slices
* Smoked salt (may substitute kosher salt)
* 2 large eggs
* 1 cup whole or low-fat buttermilk
* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons store-bought or homemade Cajun or Creole seasoning blend
* 1/4 teaspoon cayenne (optional)
* 3/4 cup cornmeal
* 3/4 cup panko bread crumbs
* 1 cup vegetable oil, such as canola
    
For the sauce

* 1/2 cup mayonnaise
* Generous 1 tablespoon ketchup
* 1 tablespoon honey
* 1 1/2 teaspoons hot sauce
* 1 teaspoon store-bought or homemade Cajun or Creole seasoning blend
* 3/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

## Directions
Make the tomatoes: Place the sliced tomatoes on a rimmed baking sheet or large platter and sprinkle on both sides with the smoked salt. Let them rest for at least 5 minutes.

In a large, shallow bowl or pie dish, beat the eggs and then add buttermilk, whisking until combined. In a separate shallow bowl or pie dish, stir together the flour, Cajun/Creole seasoning, cayenne (if using), cornmeal and panko. Dip each tomato slice in the egg mixture and then the flour mixture, using the tines of a fork to move them (fingers tend to rub off the breading). Repeat the process. Double-dipping ensures a wonderfully crisp crust. Transfer the coated slices to a separate rimmed baking sheet. Every so often, scrape off the buildup of the flour mixture that will probably accumulate on the fork, but save a little on the side for testing the frying oil's temperature. Let the breaded tomato slices rest for at least 10 minutes (about as long as it takes for the oil to heat up) to help the coating set.

Heat the oil in a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat. If you have an instant-read thermometer, check the temperature of the oil, aiming for around 300 degrees. You also can test by dropping in a small clump of the moistened breading into the oil. It should immediately start bubbling and turn golden. If the oil just soaks into the breading with very little action, it's not ready.

In batches, fry as many tomatoes as you can fit in the skillet without crowding (we did about 5), for 3 to 4 minutes, or until dark golden brown. Flip and repeat on the other side. Halfway through each batch, rotate the slices 180 degrees to ensure even browning. The oil should maintain a lively bubble, but if it's too vigorous or the breading is edging toward burned, reduce the heat as needed.

Transfer the tomatoes to a rimmed baking sheet or large platter (from the first step, just wipe it dry) lined with a double layer of paper towels to drain. Let cool slightly (the tomatoes can be very hot inside) while you make the sauce.

Make the sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, ketchup, honey, hot sauce, Cajun/Creole seasoning and Worcestershire sauce until thoroughly combined.

Serve the tomatoes warm with the sauce on the side for dipping.
