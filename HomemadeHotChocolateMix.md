## Common Allergens
* dairy
* added sugar

## Ingredients
Hot Chocolate Mix
* 2 cups (240 g) Powdered sugar
* 1 cup (85 g) Cocoa powder
* 1 cup (240 ml) Milk Powder
* 3 oz (85 g) Grated semi sweet chocolate I use 60%
* 2 tablespoon Cornstarch

Spices (optional)
* ½ teaspoon Pumpkin spice
* ½ teaspoon Cinnamon spice
* ½ teaspoon Nutmeg fresh grated

## Directions
Hot chocolate mix
* Grate the chocolate with a fine grater or use a food processor.
* Combine all ingredients in a bowl - powdered sugar, cocoa powder, milk powder, grated chocolate, cornstarch, and spices.
* Tip: A whisk works best to combine dry ingredients
* Store it in an airtight container such as a glass jar for up to 6 months.

Single serving
* Bring one cup milk to a boil in a saucepan or microwave-safe mug
* Tip: I used dairy milk but almond, or soy milk is delicious too
* Add 2 tablespoon chocolate mix to the milk – stir well to dissolve
* Return the saucepan back to heat or microwave at 30 seconds intervals
* Bring the milk to boil. This activates the cornstarch in the chocolate mix and makes the hot chocolate thick and creamy.
* Top with more grated chocolate or marshmallows.
