## Directions
For the Cake: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Grease Bundt pan with 1 tablespoon butter.

In medium saucepan, bring chopped apple and cider to boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until most of the cider has been absorbed and apples are easily smashed with a fork, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove pan from heat, cool 5 minutes, then pulse in food processor until pureed. Measure out 1 cup apple mixture and stir in milk; set aside.

In medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, nutmeg, and mace; set aside.

In large bowl, beat remaining 8 tablespoons butter, sugar, and brown sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add oil and beat until incorporated, about 1 minute.

Decrease mixer speed to low and add flour mixture in three batches, alternating with apple mixture, scraping down sides and bottom of bowl with rubber spatula as needed. Increase speed to medium and beat mixture just until combined, about 20 seconds. Add vanilla and beat once more, just to combine, about 10 seconds.

For topping: Core and thinly slice the apple, (a mandolin is useful for this). Toss apple slices in a bowl with 1 tsp. lemon juice and set aside. Melt the butter in a small saucepan with the brown sugar and cider until it is smooth and gives off a rich caramel smell. Pour the caramel into the bottom of the cake pan, and arrange the apple slices on top.

Scrape batter into prepared pan. Bake until cake tester inserted in cake comes out clean, rotating cake halfway through baking, 35 to 45 minutes. Transfer cake to cooling rack set inside baking sheet and cool in pan 15 minutes. While the cake pan is still warm, lay a flat plate over the top of the cake pan. Carefully flip the cake over onto the plate. Bang on the bottom of the pan, then lift the pan off. If a few pieces of fruit decided not to leave the pan, peel them off and arrange them back into the topping. Let the cake finish cooling.
