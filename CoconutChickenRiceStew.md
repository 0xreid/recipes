## Common Allergens
* meat
* seafood

## Ingredients
* 8 cups homemade or high-quality store-bought broth
* 1 (13.5-ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk
* 1/4 cup red curry paste
* 3 tablespoons fish sauce, plus more for seasoning
* 2 cups short-grain brown rice, rinsed
* 1 (12-ounce) bag riced cauliflower (21/2 cups)
* 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, or 4 cups shredded cooked chicken
* 1 large head napa cabbage (2 pounds), quartered lengthwise and thinly sliced
* 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves
* Kimchi, for serving (I like about 1/2 cup in my bowl)

## Directions
In a large pot, combine the broth, coconut milk, curry paste, and fish sauce. Bring to a boil over high heat and then add the rice and cauliflower. Return the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer.

**If you’re cooking the chicken thighs:**  
Simmer the rice for 18 minutes, then add the chicken thighs to the pot. Simmer until the chicken is cooked through and opaque throughout, 14 to 18 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a bowl and use two forks to shred the meat into bite-size pieces. The rice should be cooked through by now as well. Stir in the cabbage and shredded chicken; remove from the heat.

**If you’re using already cooked, shredded chicken:**  
Simmer the rice for 24 to 28 minutes, until there’s a little bite remaining to the grain. Add the shredded chicken to the pot. Cook until the chicken is heated through, about 3 minutes. The rice should be perfectly cooked through by now. Stir in the cabbage and remove from the heat.

**Serve:** Divide the soup among serving bowls and top with the cilantro. Serve with kimchi and season to taste with more fish sauce.

**To Store:** Refrigerate the soup in an airtight container for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 2 months.
