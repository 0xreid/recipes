* 1/3 cup (85ml) extra virgin olive oil
* 3/4 cup (185ml) water
* 1/2 tsp salt

### Spinach & Feta
* 300g / 10oz baby spinach
* 2 garlic cloves , minced
* 2 eggs
* 1 tsp black pepper
* 300g / 10 oz Danish feta (soft feta)
* 2 cups (200g) shredded mozzarella cheese

### Cooking / Serving
* 1 - 1.5 tbsp olive oil , per gozleme

## Directions
### Pastry
Fit stand mixer with dough hook. Combine flour, oil, salt and water in the stand mixer bowl. Mix for 2.5 minutes on medium high speed 7 until smooth (see video for before & after). (Note 4) Dough should be a pliable, smooth ball, not sticky.

Cover and rest for 20 minutes.

Sprinkle work surface with flour. Cut dough into 4 pieces.

Roll out into 35cm/14" x 20cm/8" rectangle.    

### Spinach Feta Filling
Place spinach, garlic, egg and pepper in a bowl. Scrunch with hands to reduce volume and make spinach "floppy".

Add feta and stir through.

### Gozleme
Spread Filling on half the pastry, pushing to the edge. Sprinkle Lamb/Beef Filling with crumbled feta. Sprinkle Spinach Feta with mozzarella cheese, if using.

Fold other side of pastry over to cover Filling. Press down edges, pressing out excess air pockets trapped inside as you go. Use water if needed to seal well.

Sprinkle flour on a round pizza paddle (or similar). Slide gozleme onto paddle.

### Cooking
Heat 1.5 tbsp oil in a large skillet over medium high heat.

Slide gozleme into skillet. Cook, lightly pressing down (including edges), until deep golden and crispy - about 3 minutes. Flip and cook, pressing down lightly, until crispy.
### Serving
Transfer to cutting board. Cut into 6 or 8 pieces.

Serve immediately with lemon wedges, if desired.
