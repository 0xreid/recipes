* 1/2 medium sweet onion, diced
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
* 1 pound lean ground beef
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
* 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour

* 4 cups beef stock
* 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
* 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
* 8 ounces egg noodles, uncooked
* 1/2 cup sour cream

## Directions
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are tender and browned, about 3-5 minutes; season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Add ground beef and cook until browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble the beef as it cooks.Â  Stir in garlic and thyme until fragrant, about 1 minute.

Whisk in flour until lightly browned, about 1 minute.

Stir in wine, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.

Stir in beef stock, Worcestershire, Dijon and egg noodles; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Bring to a boil; cover, reduce heat and simmer until pasta is cooked through, about 9-10 minutes.

Stir in sour cream until heated through, about 1-2 minutes.

Serve immediately, garnished with parsley, if desired.
