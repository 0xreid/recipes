# Happy Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookies

## Common Allergens
* wheat gluten
* added sugar

## Ingredients
* 2 cups unbleached flour
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* cinnamon, to taste, optional
* handful vegan chocolate or carob chips
* 1 cup raw sugar (turbinado; sucanat works too, but sucks up a lot of the moisture)
* 1/2 cup canola or vegetable oil
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 1/4 cup water

## Directions
Very important-make sure all ingredients are at room temperature. It will work if they're not at room temp but it works much better if they are. Also while your oven is pre-heating put the cookie sheets you are going to use on top of the oven so they get preheated as well. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

In a large bowl, mix together flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon. Stir in chips. Make a well in the center and set aside. In a medium size bowl, add together sugar and oil; mix well.

Add the vanilla and then add the water; mix well. Add the wet to the well in the dry. Mix it well but be careful not to overwork it. Add more chips if you need to.

Spoon onto ungreased cookie sheets. Put them in the oven. Bake for 5 minutes and then flip and rotate the sheets (top to bottom and 180 degree rotation). Bake another 4 minutes and check them. The cookies are done when they seem a little bit softer then you want them to be. They will harden up some as they cool. I usually go in 2 minute increments from here until they get to where I like them.

Take them out when they are done and move them to wire cooling racks. If they split or come apart when you try to remove them let them sit on the pan for 2 minutes before transferring them to the racks.

These cookies have come a long way, lots of time and tasting spent on getting them to where they are now. Vegans and non vegans love them. In the words of my 6 year old son:Mom, you're the greatest because you know how to make the best cookies. Enjoy and let me know if you have questions. Sweet travels.
