## Common Allergens
* dairy
* wheat gluten
* added sugar

## Ingredients
* One 14-ounce can of sweetened condensed milk
* 1 ¼ cups of cold water
* One box of vanilla pudding mix
* 3 cups heavy cream
* 4 ripe bananas
* One box of Nilla wafers

## Directions
In a medium-sized bowl whisk together sweetened condensed milk and cold water.

Place the pudding mix in another medium-sized bowl and slowly whisk in the liquid, whisking until there are no lumps and the mixture is smooth, about 1 minute. Cover and refrigerate until firm (at least one hour or overnight).

In a mixer bowl with the whisk attachment, whip the heavy cream on medium speed for about a minute until the cream starts to thicken, then increase the speed to medium high and whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Be careful not to over whip.

Carefully add the pudding mixture to the whipped cream and mix on low speed until well blended and no streaks of pudding remain.

To assemble, select either a trifle bowl or wide glass bowl with a 4- to 5-quart capacity. Saving 4 to 5 cookies for the garnish on top, begin assembly. Spread one-quarter of the pudding over the bottom and layer with one-third of the cookies and one-third of the sliced bananas (enough to cover the layer). Repeat the layering twice more. End with a final layer of pudding. Garnish the top with additional cookies or cookie crumbles.

Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours. The cookies should be tender when poked with a knife. It’s best served within 12 hours of assembling.
