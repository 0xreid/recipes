## Common Allergens
* dairy
* meat

## Ingredients
* 3 chicken thighs (bone in, skin on)
* 1 can fire roasted diced tomatoes
* 1 can mild diced green chilis
* 1 can hominy
* 1 can black beans
* 1/2 yellow onion, diced
* 2-3 cloves of garlic
* olive oil
* 3-4 cups chicken broth
* salt
* cumin
* smoked paprika
* fresh lime

Serving ingredients:
* baby spinach
* oxacana cheese
* avocado
* tortilla chips

## Directions
Sautee diced onion in olive oil. Once soft, add garlic and briefly cook.

Add half of the chicken broth, chicken thighs, and canned ingredients. Add salt, cumin, smoked paprika, and fresh lime juice. Add more broth to desired level and stir ingredients.

Pressure cook for 25 minutes.

After releasing the pressure, remove chicken thighs. Strip the meat off the bones, pull it apart to desired size, and add the meat back into the soup.

Place baby spinach and chunks of oxacana cheese in the bottom of soup bowl. Dish the hot soup on top, so it will lightly cook the spinach and melt the cheese.

Add sliced or diced fresh avocado, crumbled tortilla chips, and if desired, a final squeeze of fresh lime juice.
