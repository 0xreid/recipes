## Common Allergens
* none

## Ingredients
* 1 russet potato per person
* Olive oil
* Salt
* Pepper

## Directions
**Heat the oven to 425°F. ** Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 425ºF while you're preparing the potatoes.

**Scrub the potatoes clean.** Scrub the potatoes thoroughly under running water and pat them dry. You don't have to remove the eyes, but trim away any blemishes with a paring knife.

**Rub the potatoes with olive oil.** Rub the potatoes all over with a little olive oil. It's easiest to use your hands, but a pastry brush also works fine.

**Season the potatoes.** Generously sprinkle the potatoes on all sides with salt and pepper.

**Prick all over with a fork.** Prick the potatoes in a few places with the tines of a fork. This allows steam to escape from the baking potato.

**Bake the potatoes.** You can bake the potatoes directly on the oven rack, or you can place them a few inches apart on an aluminum foil-lined baking sheet. Bake the potatoes for 50 to 60 minutes. Flip them over every 20 minutes or so and check them for doneness by piercing them with a fork. The potatoes are done when the skins are dry and the insides feel completely soft when pierced.
