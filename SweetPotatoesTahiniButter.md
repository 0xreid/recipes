## Common Allergens
* dairy
* nuts
* seeds

## Ingredients
* 3 lb. sweet potatoes, any color (6 small or 3 large), scrubbed
* 6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature
* ¼ cup fresh lime juice
* 2 Tbsp. tahini
* 1 Tbsp. soy sauce
* 2 tsp. toasted sesame oil
* Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
* Flaky sea salt
* Toasted sesame seeds and lime wedges (for serving)

## Directions
Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a medium pot fitted with a steamer basket. Halve sweet potatoes crosswise if large and place in steamer. Cover, reduce heat to medium, and steam until fork-tender, 25–30 minutes.

Meanwhile, smash together butter, lime juice, tahini, soy sauce, and sesame oil in a small bowl with a fork until smooth, about 3 minutes. Season tahini butter with kosher salt and lots of pepper.

Arrange sweet potatoes on a platter or a large plate. Let cool until you can just handle them, then split open and generously spread tahini butter over. Season with sea salt; top liberally with sesame seeds. Serve with lime wedges (this dish really comes alive with lots of bright citrus).
