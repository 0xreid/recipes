# Lebanese Garlic Sauce (Toum)
[origin](https://thelemonbowl.com/lebanese-garlic-sauce/)

## Common Allergens
* none

## Ingredients
* 1 cup garlic cloves (peeled, roughly 3 heads of garlic)
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 3 cups canola oil (_*you may not need all of this*_)
* Â¼ cup lemon juice (about one lemon)

## Directions
Place the garlic cloves and salt in a large food processor and puree until smooth. It's a good idea to scrape down the sides two or three times to ensure that all of the garlic is finely processed.

Turn the machine back on and slowly drizzle in the oil through the lid starting with 1/2 cup. After the first 1/2 cup has been added, pour in a teaspoon of the lemon juice.

Continue alternating between 1/2 cup of the canola oil and a teaspoon of the lemon juice until you've added all of the oil and lemon juice. Alternating between the two is the key to proper emulsification which creates the light and fluffy garlic sauce. One tip is to let the machine run between oil additions to let the emulsion thicken. **NOTE: This process requires you to drizzle in the oil -- not dump in the oil right away.** When you see it begin to thicken up THEN you start with the lemon juice.

You know it's done when the sauce is white and thick with a similar consistency of mayonnaise. It usually takes about 10-15 minutes.
