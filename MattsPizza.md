## Directions
Preheat oven to 450 degrees fahrenheit.

Rollout pizza dough on floured surface into desired shape (round for a pizza stone, rectangular for a sheet pan, etc.). Transfer dough to lightly oiled sheet pan.

Grate hard cheese. Pat the fresh mozzarella dry to remove excess moisture and tear into smaller pieces.

Slice mushrooms and asparagus into bite size pieces. Dice garlic.

Mix garlic with olive oil and spread mixture on the dough.

Distribute mushrooms, asparagus, torn mozzarella, and hard cheese evenly across the dough

Bake the pizza for 20 minutes before checking for doneness, and baking in additional 5 minute increments as needed. Crust should be golden brown when done.

Let pizza cool before slicing. Top pizza with flaky salt, arugula, and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice before serving.
