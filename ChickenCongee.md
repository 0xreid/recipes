With Venting Knob in Venting Position, close the lid, then turn Venting Knob to Sealing Position. Pressure cook at High Pressure for 30 minutes + Natural Release. Open the lid carefully.

**Thicken & Season Congee:** The congee will look watery at this point. Heat up the Instant Pot using the Sauté function. Stir the congee until desired thickness & consistency, then season with salt.

**Shred Chicken:** Use tongs and fork to separate the chicken meat from the bones, then remove the chicken bones and skin (if desired). If you like, you can shred the chicken.

**Garnish & Serve:** Remove congee from heat, then garnish with green onions. Serve immediately & enjoy the comforting congee.
